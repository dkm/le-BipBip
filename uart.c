/**
* usci_serial.cpp - simple example using USCI UART + ringbuffer + command line monitor
*
* This code was written to test the new uniarch version of msp430-gcc. I wanted
* to make sure it could generate code for the msp430g2553 running on the TI
* launchpad.
*
* This code mplements a command line interface over the USB-CDC serial at
* 9600-8-N-1. To test you must swap the RX/TX pins on your launchpad to use
* the hardware USCI UART. I disconnected those jumpers on my launchpad and used
* a couple of F-M jumper wires to run the msp430g2553 from a breadboard.
* P1.1=RXD and P1.2=TXD ( this is the opposite of the msp430g2231 default setup )
*
* * License: Do with this code what you want. However, don't blame
* me if you connect it to a heart pump and it stops. This source
* is provided as is with no warranties. It probably has bugs!!
* You have been warned!
